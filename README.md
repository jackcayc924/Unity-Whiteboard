## 💡 Purpose
Welcome to Unity-Whiteboard! This whiteboard networking tool was originally developed for where security was a critical priority. However, this public version prioritizes ease of use and quick implementation rather than strict security measures. The ultimate goal is to foster collaborative note-taking in addition to supporting real-time drawing collaboration.
<br><br><b>Work in Progress: This project is currently in a heavy active development phase, and features may change frequently. As a result, support may be limited, and users should expect updates that could impact functionality.
</b>
